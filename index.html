            <h1>Hi, I'm Nahnsu!</h1>
            <p>I'm a software engineer with a background in Physics and computational simulations. I live in Minnesota with my dog, who does all the coding behind the scenes. </p>
            <p> When not behind a screen, I can be found at my local gamestore or brewery playing Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy scuba diving, snorkling, and bouldering in my free time.</p>

      <h1>2 Letters 1 Shape Project</h1>
      <p>This was a personal project to build a tool for generating 3d models of objects that look like one letter from one angle, and a different letter from a different angle. Here, maybe it's best if I just show you - like this:</p>
      <div class="half-image">
        <img src="resources/2Letters1Shape/AB-A.png">
        <img src="resources/2Letters1Shape/AB-B.png">
      </div>

      <p>It was originally inspired by a cute present idea I had for my boyfriend (since we have the same number of letters in our name), to make something that looked like my name from one angle, and his from another. Of course, I immediately started scheming as to how to make this completely generalizable, as in the curse of every mathematician. </p>
      <p>Right now, this tool has to be run locally, and the code for it
        <a href="https://github.com/nahnsu/2Letters1Shape">lives here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      I also wrote a blog post about using different generative AI models (OpenAI, Grok, and Claude) to define the geometric points of each letter, which can be found
