                <p>Many species of birds undergo migration using the
                    earth's magnetic field to nagivate. Magnetic fields, especially ones as weak as the earth's, usually
                    have little effect in the "warm, wet, and noisy" environments of biology, but a quantum process
                    known as
                    the radical pair mechanism explains many aspects of this effect. However, the sensitivity of the
                    radical
                    pair mechanism model is below what is observed in migrating birds. In this research, we attempted to create more detailed models of the radical pair mechanism in order to enhance its sensitivity.</p>
                <p>
                    Here, the radical pair mechanism is computationally modelled and compared with existing analytical
                    models. The sensitivity of our computational model of the radical pair mechanism is enhanced by the
                    addition
                    of motion between the involved radicals. The potential of radical motion as a mechanism to explain
                    the
                    extremely high sensitivity avian magnetoreception is explored with computational optimization.

                    I made this because I wanted to implement a form of my thesis with more freedom to write simply, in a way that I find more accessible. In this way, I hope to make my research more readable to the general public, and to this end, more like a
