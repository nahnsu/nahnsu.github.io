This is a science communication website that hopes to share research in quantum avian magentoreception.

FILES:
It uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are three HTML pages, one introductory page with the abstract, one page with most of the contents of the paper, and one page where the user can leave comments. The Javascript and CSS files are shared by all three HTML pages, and named javascript.js and style.css. Also included is the original paper that this website is based of, as a pdf (Master'sThesis.pdf).

STYLE:
This website uses three fonts of similar aesthetic, imported using the google font API. The default font used is Antic Slab. All headers except h6 are in Antic Didone. Figure captions, h6 headers, and other miscellaneous pieces of text are in Antic (which is sans-serif). These fonts were chosen because of their similarity to the font of the original paper.
The color scheme is relatively muted, using greys and blues. Lightgrey is used to delinate catagories, while lightslate grey is used to draw the eye, and lightsteelblue used to stop the color scheme from becoming too drab.

FUNCTIONALITY:
In order to reduce huge amounts of text, certain sections of the website will flip over when key words are clicked on to reveal more information. This allows the reader to engage with the text on a variety of levels, while also having more information immediately available.

FUTURE GOALS:
1: A live comments section (as of yet, comments only last per session). This would require a connection to a database, or usage of some API, where comments are stored and loaded.
2: 180 flip of the information cards without text being backwards. I just couldn't figure out how to do this.
3: Content (having the rest of the paper transfered to the website)
