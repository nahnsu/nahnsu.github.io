                            During migration, birds
                            display an ability to travel during day and night, across large areas of featureless ocean
                            or desert, correcting course when displaced [<a

                            visual and olfactory markers to form a map, but also have an internal compass by which they
                            are able to determine their orientation, thus allowing them to perform true navigation [<a

                            Experiment reveals that birds are sensitive to magnetic fields on the order of the Earth’s

                                The Earth’s magnetic field does not usually have an impact on biological systems because it
                                is so weak: the effect of <a class="flip-trigger"

                                stronger than any interactions between
                                organic matter and the field. This raises the question of how birds could be using this
                                field to navigate, as they do not
                                contain high levels of ferromagnetic materials that would facilitate magnetoreception [5].

                        <p> "Thermal fluctuations" here refers to the fact that in the biological systems, molecules are
                            constantly being jostled around and thermally equilibrated. Any effect due to the magnetic
                            field would have to be robust to this constant movement. The radical pair mechanism works because the
                            spins of the radical are not thermally equilibrated <br>

                            While a weak field is unlikely to have an effect on its own, it might bias the final state
                            of a system far from equilibrium, where there are several equally possible outcomes.

                            more than it would be able to if the rock were stable.

                            Schulten et al. first proposed a chemical mechanism for avian magnetoreception in 1978, in
                            which a chemical reaction with a magnetically sensitive transient radical pair had a final
                            yield dependent on the direction of an external magnetic field [6].

                            Cryptochrome, a light sensitive protein found in the bird’s eye, was found to form
                            a radical pair when exposed to blue light [7]. The radical pair is
                            created when blue light breaks a chemical bond, exciting the flavin adenin dinucleotide
                            (FAD) and a triad of tryptophan amino acids (Trp) that consist the cryptochrome.

                        The electrons, freed from their chemicals bonds, transfer such that there is one free electon at
                        each site. Electrons in a chemical bond must have opposite spins, due to the Pauli exclusion
                        principle, but the radical pair electrons can have the same spin.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        To be more specific, the opposite spin state is a superposition of the two possible ways of
                        having opposite spins,
                        ( \( \uparrow _1 + \downarrow _2 \) ) and ( \( \downarrow _1 + \uparrow _2 \) ), having a
                        wavefunction of \( S_0 = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2}} ( \uparrow _1 + \downarrow _2 \) ) - ( \(
                        \downarrow _1 + \uparrow _2) \), known as the singlet state because of it's unicity.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Conversely, there are three ways for the electrons to have the same spin, and thus this is
                        called the triplet state. These are:
                        <ol>
                            <li>both electrons being spin up ( \( \uparrow _1 + \uparrow _2 \) )</li>
                            <li>both electrons being spin down ( \( \downarrow _1 + \downarrow _2 \) )</li>
                            <li>
                                a superposition spin up and down, ( \( \uparrow _1 + \downarrow _2 \) ) + ( \(
                                \downarrow _1 + \uparrow _2) \).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        If the electrons stay in the singlet state, they can recombine into their original bond. However, if the electrons enter the triplet state, their spins forbid them from forming this bond, and they go on to form a novel compound, as shown in <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>

                        The hyperfine interactions between the radicals and nearby nuclear spins induce singlet-triplet
                        interconversion, with the radical pair oscilating between these two states. This nuclear spin
                        could be supplied by nitrogen or hydrogen, which are common in biological matter and exist in
                        cryptochrome [8].
